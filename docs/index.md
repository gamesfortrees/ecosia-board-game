![Ecosia Board Game](assets/img/trees_banner.png)

**Ecosia: the board game** is the fun co-op board game that you probably already own! Based on the popular game about colonialism and resource extraction _Settlers of Catan_, we've remagined what living in the island of Catan could be like if humans and nature could co-exist.

## Materials needed

Part of the idea of a sustainable board game is to avoid having to buy a new game. We encourage you to repurpose the cards and pieces from Catan and other games, but you can also print our custom-made card deck. To play **Ecosia: the board game** you will need:

*   Settlers of Catan basic board
*   Number tiles from Catan, and a bag to place them
*   Catan's resource cards + knight cards (or print our tree management deck)
*   A Standard 52-card deck (or print our event deck)
*   1 D4 die
*   3 sets of at least 15 identical pieces to represent 3 species of trees
*   A first-player token
