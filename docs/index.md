## About

**Ecosia: the board game** is the fun co-op board game that you probably already own!

Based on the popular game about colonialism and resource extraction _Settlers of Catan_, we've re-imagined what living in the island of Catan could be like if humans and nature could co-exist.

This game was developed by a group of board game fans at Ecosia with a multitude of skills, but more importantly a love for trees, nature and the environment. It features a mix of strategy and luck. If you decide to give it a try, we would love to hear back from you over on our Github page.

**Players**: 1-6 (ideally 4) | **Duration**: 30-40 minutes

## Materials needed

Part of the idea of a sustainable board game is to avoid having to buy a new game. We encourage you to repurpose the cards and pieces from Catan and other games, but you can also print our custom-made card deck. To play **Ecosia: the board game** you will need:

* Settlers of Catan basic board
* Number tokens from Catan (2-12)
* Catan's resource cards + knight cards (or print [our tree management deck](https://github.com/gamesfortrees/ecosia-board-game/tree/main/cards))
* A Standard 52-card deck (or print our [event deck](https://github.com/gamesfortrees/ecosia-board-game/tree/main/cards))
* 1 D6 die, or a spinner, to choose a random direction
* 3 sets of at least 15 identical pieces to represent 3 species of trees
* A first-player token (e.g. the robbers token from Catan)
* A small opaque bag to place the numbers (should fit your hand)
