![Ecosia Board Game](assets/img/trees_banner.jpg)

**Ecosia: the board game** is the fun co-op board game that you probably already own! Based on the popular game about colonialism and resource extraction _Settlers of Catan_, we've remagined what living in the island of Catan could be like if humans and nature could co-exist.

## Materials needed

Part of the idea of a sustainable board game is to avoid having to buy a new game. We encourage you to repurpose the cards and pieces from Catan and other games, but you can also print our custom-made card deck. To play **Ecosia: the board game** you will need:

*   Settlers of Catan basic board
*   Number tiles from Catan, and a bag to place them
*   Catan's resource cards + knight cards (or print our tree management deck)
*   A Standard 52-card deck (or print our event deck)
*   1 D4 die
*   3 sets of at least 15 identical pieces to represent 3 species of trees
*   A first-player token

## Concepts

### Starting Player

Every round a new player starts the round. For that roun they are the starting player. After the event card is drawn, the player on the left of the starting player starts a new round.

### Player’s hand

A player always has three cards that compose their hand. Those are the played cards on their turn. They are public and can be visible to other players.

### Connected tiles

Connected tiles are tiles adjacent to each other that have at least one tree planted on them. There is no limit to how many tiles can be connected.

A nursery is connected to a tile if it can reach

### Deforested area

A deforested area is a specific area where no trees can be planted until it is reforested (see “Reforestation development card”).  At the start of the game, this is only the “desert” tile, but other tiles can become deforested areas and this would be symbolized by turning them over.

### Dominant species

The species that has the most units in a tile. If tied, there is no dominant species.

### Monoculture

A monoculture is a tile with a single species of tree present or a dominant species that has more than double the units than other species combined. A tile is still a monoculture even if only one unit is present.

### The nursery

Seedling production is a bottleneck for reforestation projects. In the game, nurseries are located on each of the ports drawn on the map. This is where the seedlings will stay until it is time to plant them. A player can only plant trees in tiles adjacent to nurseries or adjacent to tiles that already have trees and are connected to the nursery holding the seedlings to be planted.
