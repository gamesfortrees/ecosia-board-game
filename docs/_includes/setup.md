## Setup

1. Lay out the different terrain hexes randomly, but keep the desert in the center of the board.
2. Place the surrounding ocean pieces around the tiles just like you would for Catan (there are numbers that indicate how they fit together around the map).
3. Place the number 12 token on the deforested area in the middle. Place all the other numbers in the bag.
4. Prepare the **forest management deck**. The amount of cards of each type depends on the player count:

    | Players | Cards of each type |
    | --------- | ----------|
    | 6 | 14 cards |
    | 5 | 12 cards |
    | 4 | 10 cards |
    | 3 | 8 cards |
    | 2 | 6 cards |
    | 1 | 5 cards |

    ℹ️ There should be fewer reforestation cards; take out as many reforestation cards as there are payers.

5. To prepare the **event card deck**, draw 10 random event cards and place them in the middle of the table with the face turned down.
6. Place one random tree species in each Forest tile.
7. Place one random tree species in each Nursery.
8. Leave the rest of the tree pieces next to the board grouped by the different species. This is what is called your Reserve.
9. Each player draws 3 cards from the deck to make up their initial hand. You can choose to play with an open hand.
10. The player who last used Ecosia goes first.
