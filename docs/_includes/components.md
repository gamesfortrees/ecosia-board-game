### The board

The game uses a regular Catan board. There are 6 types of tiles, plus the ocean:

- 🌵 **Deforested area** tiles (aka the desert) where trees can’t grow unless it’s reforested
- 🌾 **Farmland** tiles (aka fields) will try to expand, but growing trees in them is beneficial
- 🏔 **Water spring** tiles (aka mountains) produce water for the surroundings
- 🏜 **Dry lands** tiles (aka hills) can grow trees but are more prone to wildfires
- 🌳 **Forest** tiles (aka forest) starts with 1 random tree unit
- 🌿 **Meadow** tiles (aka pasture) just start empty
- ⚓️ **Nurseries** are the docks on the cost, and is where tree saplings will be places

### The trees

There are different species of trees that can be planted. The game requires 3 species of trees. What the species are is not relevant for the gameplay, just the potential diversity. If you want to get inspired, check out [Ecosia’s blog](https://blog.ecosia.org/tag/where-does-ecosia-plant-trees/) and see which species are planted on which project.

For the purpose of this game, the tree pieces are an **unlimited resource**. You should be good with 15-20 of each type, but feel free to use any suitable replacement if run out. Tree pieces are also called “tree units” throughout the rulebook.

You can use cubes of 3 different colors or 3 kinds of meeple from other games. You can also create your own tree tokens out of clay or simply use the streets and cities of Catan to represent trees.

### First player token

To make it clearer who the first player is, you can use any small object you have around. This will switch between players on each round. You can use the robbers figurine for this purpose.
