## Game Components

## ♟ The board

The game uses a regular Catan board. There are 6 types of tiles, plus the ocean:

- 🌵 **Deforested area** tiles** (aka the desert) where trees can’t grow unless it’s reforested
- 🌾 **Farmland** tiles (aka fields) will try to expand, but growing trees in them is beneficial
- 🏔 **Water spring** tiles (aka mountains) produce water for the surroundings
- 🏜 **Dry lands** tiles (aka hills) can grow trees but are more prone to wildfires
- 🌳 **Forest** tiles (aka forest)** starts with 1 random tree unit
- 🌿 **Meadow** tiles** (aka pasture) just start empty
- ⚓️ **Nurseries** are the docks on the cost, and is where tree saplings will be places

## The trees

There are different species of trees that can be planted. The game requires 3 species of trees. What the species are is not relevant for the gameplay, just the potential diversity. If you want to get inspired, check out [Ecosia’s blog](https://blog.ecosia.org/tag/where-does-ecosia-plant-trees/) and see which species are planted on which project.

For the purpose of this game, the tree pieces are an **unlimited resource**. You should be good with 15-20 of each type, but feel free to use any suitable replacement if run out. Tree pieces are also called “tree units” throughout the rulebook.

You can use cubes of 3 different colors or 3 kinds of meeple from other games. You can also create your own tree tokens out of clay or simply use the streets and cities of Catan to represent trees.

## Dice

You will need one D6 to play the game; you can use one of the already included in Catan.

## First player token

To make it clearer who the first player is, you can use any small object you have around. This will switch between players on each round. You can use the robbers figurine for this purpose.

## Forest management deck

This card deck consists of the actions the players can play to protect and grow the forests of Catan. It contains 6 types of actions. The amount of each card depends on the number of players - see [Setup](setup) for more detailed instructions.

We have created a custom deck that you can print. Alternatively, you can reuse Catan’s resource and development cards for this purpose. 

| Catan Card | Meaning |
|------------|----------|
| 🐑 Sheep   | 🌱 Nursery  |
| 🪵 Wood    | 🌳 Plant  |
| 🌾 Wheat   | 🤲 Prune  |
| 🧱 Brick   | 💞 Natural reforestation  |
| 🗻 Rock    | 💧 Reforestation  |
| 🐴 Knight  | 👩‍🌾 Agroforestry  |

### 🌱 Nursery

Place 3 trees in any nurseries of your choice. You may distribute these trees across multiple nurseries and mix different species as you see fit.

🌅 If using Catan components, we recommend making “Sheep” resource cards as “Nursery”.

📚*Finding and growing seedlings is one of the bottlenecks of planting trees, nurseries are important to overcome this problem.*

### 🌳 Plant

Plant a tree on a tile from a selected nursery, except on a deforested tile. You must use a tree unit from a nursery that is connected to that tile (see “Connected Tiles” under “Concepts” for details).

🌅 If using Catan components, we recommend making “Wood” resource cards as “Plant”.

📚 *Planting trees is one of the best ways to reforest the planet and fight climate change.*

### 🤲 Prune

Add a tree unit to a selected tile, matching a species of a tree already planted there. This tree unit should come from your reserve (not from a nursery).

🌅If using Catan components, we recommend making “Wheat” resource cards as “Prune”.

📚 *Pruning makes trees grow bigger and healthier, which is important to be the most efficient we can when generating biomass, which in turn captures more co2.*

### 💞 Natural reforestation

Add a tree unit of the same species between two tiles where that species is already planted.  This tree unit should come from your reserve (not from a nursery).

The images below explain what valid in between tiles are.

🌅If using Catan components, we recommend making “Clay” resource cards as “Natural reforestation”.

📚 *To facilitate tree monitoring, we plant threes in lines. This way we can easily identify that trees that appear “outside the line” have been seeded naturally.*

### 👩‍🌾 Agroforestry

Increasing tree diversity on a farmland to create a productive system that mimics nature.

1. Select one tree from a nursery connected to a farmland tile (see “Connected Tiles” under “Concepts” for details).
1. Plant this tree in the chosen farmland tile, ensuring no other tree of the same species is already present.
1. After planting, add 2 trees of any species to the nursery from which you took the tree.

🌅 If using Catan components, we recommend making “Knight” resource cards as “Agroforestry”.

📚 *These productive systems require less maintainability. The trees need to be complementary to each other, for example occupying different layers of the forest. This means a much higher profit margin that supports villages in developing countries. Ecosia does this for many of the projects ensuring that trees have a high survival rate.*

### 💧 Reforestation

Bring life back to any deforested area of your choosing by planting different trees from connected nurseries in it (see “Connected Tiles” under “Concepts” for details).

1. Calculate the total number of trees already planted in the tiles surrounding the deforested area. Ensure this number meets or exceeds the value shown on the deforested area's number token. If not, you cannot proceed with reforestation.
1. If the condition in step 1 is satisfied, you plant trees in the deforested area equal to half of the number on the deforested area's number token (rounded down).
   1. You can choose trees from different nurseries connected to the deforested area to fulfill the planting requirement.
   1. If you do not have enough trees to plant, you also cannot proceed with reforestation.

🌅If using Catan components, we recommend making “Stone” resource cards as “Reforestation”.

*📚 To reforest areas that have scarce rains, we use the Half Moon technique, where we dig half moon shaped holes and plant the trees inside it so that more water is retained when it does rain.*
