### Forest management deck

This card deck consists of the actions the players can play to protect and grow the forests of Catan. It contains 6 types of actions. The amount of each card depends on the number of players - see [Setup](setup) for more detailed instructions.

We have created a custom deck that you can print. Alternatively, you can reuse Catan’s resource and development cards for this purpose.

#### 🌱 Nursery

Place 3 trees in any nurseries of your choice. You may distribute these trees across multiple nurseries and mix different species as you see fit.

> 📚 *Finding and growing seedlings is one of the bottlenecks of planting trees, nurseries are important to overcome this problem.*

#### 🌳 Plant

Plant a tree on a tile from a selected nursery, except on a [deforested area](#deforested-area). You must use a tree unit from a nursery that is connected to that tile (see [Connected Tiles](#connected-tiles)).


> 📚 *Planting trees is one of the best ways to reforest the planet and fight climate change.*

#### 🤲 Prune

To a tile of your choice, add a tree unit of a species already planted there. This tree should come from your reserve (not from a nursery).

> 📚 *Pruning makes trees grow bigger and healthier, which is important to be the most efficient we can when generating biomass, which in turn captures more co2.*

#### 💞 Natural reforestation

Add a tree unit of the same species between two tiles where that species is already planted. This tree unit should come from your reserve (not from a nursery).

The following graphic illustrates the valid reforestation positions.

> 📚 *To facilitate tree monitoring, we plant threes in lines. This way we can easily identify that trees that appear “outside the line” have been seeded naturally.*

#### 👩‍🌾 Agroforestry

Increase tree diversity on a farmland to create a productive system that mimics nature:

1. Select one tree from a nursery connected to a farmland tile (see [Connected Tiles](#connected-tiles) under [Concepts](#concepts)).
1. Plant this tree in the chosen farmland tile, ensuring no other tree of the same species is already present.
1. After planting, add 2 trees of any species to the nursery from which you took the tree.

📚 *These productive systems require less maintainability. The trees need to be complementary to each other, for example occupying different layers of the forest. This means a much higher profit margin that supports villages in developing countries. Ecosia does this for many of the projects ensuring that trees have a high survival rate.*

#### 💧 Reforestation

Bring life back to a deforested area of your choosing by planting different trees from connected nurseries in it (see [Connected Tiles](#connected-tiles)).

1. Calculate the total number of trees already planted in the tiles surrounding the deforested area. Ensure this number meets or exceeds the value shown on the deforested area's number token. If not, you cannot proceed with reforestation.
1. If condition 1 is satisfied, you plant trees in the deforested area equal to half of the number on the deforested area's number token (rounded down).
1. You can choose trees from different nurseries connected to the deforested area to fulfill the planting requirement.
1. If you do not have enough trees to plant, you also cannot proceed with reforestation.
1. If the reforested tile is facing down, flip it back and discard the number token.

> *📚 To reforest areas that have scarce rains, we use the Half Moon technique, where we dig half moon shaped holes and plant the trees inside it so that more water is retained when it does rain.*
