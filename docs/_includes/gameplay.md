## Gameplay

Beginning with the starting player and proceeding clockwise around the table, players will take turns playing forest management cards to plant or propagate trees.

1. First the active player can either:
    - Play a card from their hand, apply its effect and then discard it
    - Discard one or all of their cards
2. Then, draw cards until they have 3 cards in their hand

At the end of each round, an event card is revealed, with potentially damaging effects to the trees and the environment.
The length of a round depends on the number of players.

| 1 player | 3 plays/turn |
| 2 players | 2 plays/turn |
| 3-4 players | 1 play/turn |
| 5-6 players | 1 turn every 4 plays |

The starting player reveals the next event card, applies its effects, and discards the event card. 
The first-player token is passed to the next player and a new round starts.

### Game End

If the players are able to eliminate all deforested areas, **the game is won**. However, they must do so before the 10 events occur. After the 10th event occurs, the players may continue for one last round. If there are still any outstanding deforested areas in Catan, **the game is lost**.

### Scoring

Players can calculate how well they did if they win the game. The scoring system is based on how many tons of CO<sub>2</sub> the reforested areas will sequester in a year. Each tree unit placed on the board represents 1 hectare of planted forest. More tree units at the end of the game increase the CO<sub>2</sub> sequestering capacity.

Biodiverse forests sequester more CO<sub>2</sub> than monocultures over time, therefore tiles containing more biodiversity will score higher. Use the table below to calculate the final score:

| Biodiversity level | CO<sub>2</sub> sequestering capacity | Point per tree unit |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Monoculture tile | 5 - 20 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year | 1 points |
| 2 species and no monoculture | 10 - 20 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year | 2 points |
| 3 species and no monoculture | 10 - 30 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year | 3 points |
