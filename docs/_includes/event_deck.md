### Event deck

This deck consists of the possible damaging events that affect the trees, potentially causing more deforestation. Most times this affects tiles closest to the current starting player for that round.

♻️ For this deck you will need 6 types of actions and two cards of each type. Your can print our custom event deck, or you can use cards some a standard deck, for example:

| ♠️♥️ Card ♦️♣️ | Meaning |
|------------|----------|
| Ace | [🏜 Deforestation](#-deforestation) |
| Two | [🚜 Encroaching](#-encroaching) |
| Three | [🌊 Heavy rain ](#-heavy-rain ) |
| Jack | [🔥 Wildfire](#-wildfire) |
| Queen | [🦠 Pest](#-pest) |
| King | [♨️ Drought](#-drought) |

#### 🏜 Deforestation

The highest-numbered deforested area will try to expand:

1. Randomly decide to which side it will expand to, you can for example assign one number to each side and roll a D6. Feel free to use alternative methods like *spin the bottle*.
1. All trees of the dominant species in that tile are killed. If there is a tie, the players need to choose which one of the tied species to get killed.
1. If there are no trees left after removing the trees in that tile (even if none were killed), it becomes a deforested area. Turn over that tile to signalize it.
1. Get a random number from the numbers bag and put it on that tile.

📚*One of the worst effects of climate change is higher temperatures, making it harder for trees to survive.*

#### 🚜 Encroaching

The farmlands want to expand. For each farmland tile, destroy all trees of one species. If there are multiple species present, players choose which species to remove. If there are any empty farmland tiles after that, encroaching happens. If multiple tiles are empty, do it only for the one closest to the player.

1. Identify the farmland tile closest to the starting player that currently has no trees.
1. Choose an adjacent tile (not another farmland) for the expansion. If there were any trees on the chosen tile, remove them.
1. Remove the adjacent tile and move the farmland tile there.
1. Flip over the removed adjacent tile and place it on the place where the farmland previously was. This is now a deforested area and you need to assign it a number like described above on “Deforestation”.

> 📚 *Human civilization continuously deforests areas to use as farmland. This is especially a big problem for monoculture plantations, since the quality of the soil after harvesting is so bad that it is much cheaper to just move to a different area instead of planting again, causing more deforestation.*

#### 🌊 Heavy rain

Add 1 tree to one tile surrounding each water spring tile. You don’t need to use trees from nurseries and can choose the tile and species you plant. Then run the “Deforestation” event.

> 📚 *Climate change increases the amount and intensity of rains, flooding susceptible areas. This suffocates trees, but also is a problem for many people living in affected areas. Heavy rain also causes erosion, which trees can help prevent by increasing the retention of water and nutrients.*

#### 🔥 Wildfire

In the dry land tile closest to the player, a fire starts. All trees in Monoculture (see [monoculture](#monoculture) under [concepts](#concepts)) in that tile and in the adjacent tile, die. If one or more adjacent tiles are empty after this (even if no trees were killed), players have to choose one of them to become deforested, assign a number to it as well.

> 📚 *As a result of climate change, many areas are drier and much more susceptible to wildfires. Forest fires are also unfortunately used as deforestation techniques by humans and often grow out of control and become wildfire.*

#### 🦠 Pest

Find the tile with a Monoculture (see [monoculture](#monoculture)) closest to the player. Then, on all tiles on the board, reduce the number of trees of that species by 1.

> 📚 *Less diversity, which is usually caused by humans, makes forests much more susceptible to pests, such as bugs or diseases, that proliferate and devastate the environment.*

#### ♨️ Drought

Remove 1 tree from 1 spring tile; then for each spring tile without any trees, remove one tree from one adjacent tile. If one or more tiles are empty after this (even if no trees were killed), players have to choose one of them to become deforested, assign a number to it as well.

> 📚 *Deforestation drastically changes rain patterns, causing drought in many areas affecting water availability for trees.*
