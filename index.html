    <h1>Ecosia: the board game</h1>
    <h2>The sustainable game that teaches about reforesting</h2>

    <p>
        <b>Ecosia: the board game</b> is the fun co-op board game that you probably already own!
        Based on the popular game about colonialism and resource extraction <em>Settlers of Catan</em>, we've remagined what living in the island of Catan could be like if humans and nature could co-exist.

    <h3>Material needed</h3>

    <p>
        Part of the idea of a sustainable board game is to avoid having to buy a new game. We encourage you to repurpose the cards and pieces from Catan and other games, but you can also print our custom-made card deck. To play <b>Ecosia: the board game</b> you will need:

        <ul>
            <li>Settlers of Catan basic board</li>
            <li>Catan's resource cards + knight cards (or print our tree management deck)</li>
            <li>A Standard 52-card deck (or print our event deck)</li>
            <li>1 D4 die</li>
            <li>3 sets of at least 15 identical pieces to represent 3 species of trees</li>
            <li>A first-player token</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
